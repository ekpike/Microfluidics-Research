Smoldyn simulation files for Nanoscale Digital Logic with Chemical Reactions. To run, download and configure Smoldyn on your device and execute the simulations from the command line.

The final gates files contain the files for each logic gate discussed in the paper. The output files contain the molecule count of the species of interest (in the output compartment), the prototypes folder contains rudimentary channels and early protoypes of the logic gates.
